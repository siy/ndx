# Changelog

## v0.5.1 — QoL: auto-gitignore .ndx/

- `ndx init` and `ndx recall init` now automatically add `.ndx/` to the project's `.gitignore` (creates the file if absent, idempotent on re-run)

## v0.5.0 — Recall: Structured Episodic Memory Palace

Released 2026-04-09. Design spec: [`docs/specs/recall.md`](docs/specs/recall.md).

### Added

#### Recall palace (`ndx recall`)
- **Per-project structured memory** at `{project}/.ndx/recall.redb` with drawers (atomic memory units), rooms (topic buckets), and typed links (`references`, `contradicts`, `supersedes`, `derived_from`)
- **BLAKE3 content-hash dedup** — repeat ingests bump importance on the existing drawer instead of creating duplicates
- **4-layer retrieval ladder:**
  - **L0** — identity text rendered from global `~/.ndx/identity.toml` deep-merged with optional per-project override
  - **L1** — importance-ranked, room-grouped wake-up text (top 15 drawers, ≤3200 chars, excludes `Supersedes` targets)
  - **L2** — room-filtered retrieval via `ndx recall get --room <name>`
  - **L3** — hybrid search: fastembed `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` cosine (K_sem=50) fused with trigram intersection (K_lex=50) via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60)
- **Three mining modes:** `mine --from-memory` (turn-pair drawers from global session history filtered by current project), `mine --from-chroma <path>` (direct sqlite read of a mempalace ChromaDB export), `mine --project [--path]` (walks the project tree and paragraph-chunks text files)
- **Full drawer CRUD** — `drawer add|list|show|update|rm|link|unlink` with cascade on delete across all satellite tables
- **Claude-curated maintenance via slash commands** — `/ndx-recall-classify`, `/ndx-recall-score`, `/ndx-recall-dedupe`, `/ndx-recall-contradict`, `/ndx-recall-summarize` delegate judgment to Claude Code and round-trip through `ndx recall drawer` CLI
- **Pending-op read schema** — `drawer list --pending <op> --json` emits `{op, project, drawers, cursor}` for skill batch consumption
- **Structured JSON write-back envelopes** — all `--json` write commands emit `{"ok": bool, ...}` on stdout; JSON error envelopes emit `{"ok": false, "error": ..., "code": N}` with the correct exit code

#### Cross-references
- `ndx xref drawer <file>` — resolves file paths to drawers via direct `source_file` match plus trigram-narrowed basename substring confirm
- `ndx xref drawer-session <session-id>` — drawers derived from a session
- `ndx xref git <commit>` — walks `git diff-tree` for the commit, unions drawer sets across changed files, caches the result (passive, no git hooks installed)

#### Hook wake-up injection
- PreToolUse Bash hook injects L0+L1 wake-up text exactly once per Claude session, wrapped in a `# ndx-recall wake-up (session ...)` marker block
- Soft-fails at every decision point (no session id, no cwd, no palace, embedder error) so existing manifest-hint behavior is unaffected
- `ndx recall wake --force` clears all session markers so the next Bash hook re-injects (picks up `identity.toml` edits, for example)

#### Skills and installation
- `ndx install` now drops 6 skill files (main `ndx.md` + 5 recall slash commands) to `~/.claude/commands/`
- `ndx init <path>` drops the same 6 files to `<path>/.claude/commands/`
- Main `ndx.md` rewritten with full recall surface documentation

### Dependencies
- Added `fastembed = "4"` for local MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings (pulls `ort` / onnxruntime)
- Added `toml = "0.8"` for identity file parsing
- Added `rusqlite = "0.32"` (bundled) for direct mempalace ChromaDB read
- Added `blake3 = "1"` for content hashing

### Deliberate non-goals
- No AAAK compression layer (mempalace's lossy dialect; benchmark regression)
- No MCP server (ndx is pure CLI, subagent-friendly by construction)
- No ChromaDB runtime dependency (only read-only import)
- No global cross-project palace in v1 (identity is global, drawers are strictly per-project)
- No pre-commit git hooks (cross-ref is on-demand only)
- No heuristic NLP in Rust (classification/scoring/dedup/contradict/summarize all delegate to Claude via skills)

### Migration notes
This is a pure addition: all existing file-index, memory, xref, and hook behaviors are preserved. The file-index daemon and `~/.ndx/memory.redb` are unchanged. Recall palaces are opt-in via `ndx recall init`.

## v0.4.0 — Parallel Indexing & Incremental Scanning

### Added
- **Incremental scanning** — tracks mtime/size per file in FILE_HASHES table; only changed files are re-indexed on daemon restart
- **Parallel trigram extraction** — rayon-based parallel content indexing (3-5x speedup on large projects)
- **Watcher debouncing** — 200ms debounce window batches filesystem events into bulk transactions
- **Parallel manifest downloads** — ureq + rayon replaces 289 sequential curl subprocesses (~20x faster)
- **Doc ID persistence** — next_doc_id restored from META table across daemon restarts (no ID collisions)
- **Batch file removal** — `remove_files_batch()` handles deletions in a single transaction
- **Pre-computed trigram indexing** — `index_content_batch_precomputed()` accepts pre-extracted trigram maps for parallel pipelines

### Changed
- **Streaming trigram extraction** — replaced `HashSet<u32>` per trigram with `Vec<u32>` + last-element dedup (halves memory for large files)
- **Scanner no longer calls `index.clear()`** — incremental diff instead of full rebuild
- **Watcher processes events in batches** — 3 transactions per batch instead of N per-file transactions

### Dependencies
- Added `rayon = "1"` for data parallelism
- Added `ureq = "2"` for HTTP (replaces curl subprocesses)

## v0.3.0 — CLI + Daemon Architecture

**Breaking change:** ndx is no longer an MCP server. It is now a pure CLI tool backed by a background daemon.

### Added
- **Background daemon** — auto-starts on first index query, owns the project index exclusively, keeps it current via filesystem watcher
- **Unix domain socket IPC** — CLI commands communicate with daemon via `.ndx/ndx.sock`
- **CLI subcommands** — `search`, `list`, `find`, `status`, `memory`, `xref`, `ping`, `stop`
- **Auto-start** — daemon spawns automatically on first CLI query; no manual setup needed
- **Stale socket detection** — client detects dead daemons, cleans up, and restarts
- **Daemon logging** — stderr output goes to `.ndx/ndx.log`
- **Claude Code skill** — `ndx init` installs a skill file to `.claude/commands/ndx.md`
- **Global skill install** — `ndx install` registers the skill in `~/.claude/commands/`

### Changed
- **No MCP dependency** — removed `rmcp` and `schemars` crates
- **Subagent-friendly** — all functionality accessible via Bash, works from subagents and team members
- **Memory commands use direct access** — no daemon needed for session/event/agent queries
- **`ndx init`** — now installs skill file instead of creating `.mcp.json`
- **`ndx install`** — registers hook + skill (no longer registers MCP server); cleans up old MCP entries

### Removed
- MCP server mode (`ndx [path]` no longer starts an MCP server)
- `rmcp`, `schemars` dependencies

## v0.2.0 — Episodic Memory, Command Hooks, Cross-Referencing

### Added
- Episodic memory — indexes Claude Code session transcripts for full-text search
- Command hooks — PreToolUse syntax injection and output filtering via YAML manifests
- Cross-referencing — file-to-session and session-to-file queries
- Subagent transcript parsing and search
- Event logging (Phase C) for command history
- `ndx install` — downloads 289 command manifests from kcp-commands
- `ndx scan` — explicit memory scanning
- Context lines, output modes, pagination, glob filter for content search
- ISO 8601 timestamp formatting

## v0.1.0 — Initial Release

### Added
- File metadata index with prefix and glob filtering
- Trigram content search with line-level positions
- Filesystem watcher for real-time index updates
- Gitignore-aware scanning
- MCP server on stdio
- redb embedded database
